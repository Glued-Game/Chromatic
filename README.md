anti-shooter
============

## What needs to be done (These are just generic things, not really even sure why I have this...)

### Gameplay
* Adjust LERP_SPEED/use a different method such as a constant speed
* Create GUI

### ART
* Player
* Enemies
* Friendlies

### Sounds
* Picking up a color
* Getting killed
* Music


First, I think we should come up with what we want it to look like.
